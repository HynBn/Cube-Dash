<h1>What is Cube Dash?</h1>

Cube Dash is a 2D Endless Runner Arcade Game that is slightly based on the mobile Game, "Geometry Dash".  Here you need to collect the coins that are flying by to gain points while dodging the obstacles in your way. Use platforms to reach points or to get away from obstacles. 

You can press and hold the spacebar to Jump as high as you can or tap the spacebar to Jump slightly. Press S to Crouch and dodge certain obstacles. 


<h1>About the Project</h1>

This is a small University Project, where we had to either build a small Game in 2D or 3D, or create a small Game Tool within a month. I decided on this small 2D Game, as I have almost no experience with developing games. Due to the lack of experience, I used lots of YouTube Tutorials to get me through this project (some of them are linked down below). 
As this is my first solo project game, this has a lot of bugs and problems. They might or might not be updated at a later time :)
